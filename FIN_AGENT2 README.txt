Detailed Code Explanation
The system is built using Python and integrates several libraries and tools to create intelligent agents. Below is a detailed breakdown of how the system works:

1. Loading Environment Variables
The dotenv library is used to load environment variables from a .env file into the program. This is useful for securely storing sensitive information like API keys.

2. Creating the Web Agent
The web_agent is created using the Agent class. This agent is specialized to search the web using the DuckDuckGo tool. The model used by the agent is Groq (llama-3.3-70b-versatile), and it has specific instructions to always provide sources in its responses and format results using markdown. The agent’s response includes not only the information gathered but also a note of which tool was used to gather it.

3. Creating the Finance Agent
The finance_agent is another AI agent, but its purpose is different: it focuses on financial data. This agent uses the YFinanceTools to gather stock prices, analyst recommendations, and company information. Just like the web agent, it follows specific instructions, such as displaying data in tables. It also uses the Groq model for generating responses and is set to show tool calls, meaning it will print out the tools it uses when gathering data.

4. Creating an Agent Team
The agent_team is an AI agent that combines the web_agent and finance_agent. The team uses the same model (Groq) and follows the same general instructions (such as including sources and formatting results in tables). The team can be given more complex tasks, like summarizing both financial and news data for a specific company, with the agents collaborating to provide a comprehensive response.

5. Using the Agent Team to Perform a Task
Finally, the agent_team can be asked to perform a task. For example, you can ask the team to summarize analyst recommendations and share the latest news for a specific stock, such as NVIDIA (NVDA). The stream=True option ensures that the team’s responses are printed in real-time as they process the task, making the output dynamic and immediate.

How It Works
Individual Agents: Each agent is specialized for a particular task:

The web_agent handles web searches using the DuckDuckGo tool.
The finance_agent retrieves financial data using the YFinance API.
Team of Agents: The agents can work together as a team. For example, you can ask the team to gather information from both the web and financial databases and present it in a unified response.

Instructions and Tools: Every agent follows specific instructions (like including sources or formatting data in tables) and uses external tools to get information (like DuckDuckGo for web searches or YFinance for financial data).

Real-Time Responses: The stream=True option ensures that the agents return results as soon as they have gathered the data, instead of waiting until everything is done.
